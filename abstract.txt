In gamma-ray astronomy, a variety of data formats and proprietary software
exist, developed for one specific mission or experiment. Especially in
ground-based gamma-ray astronomy, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT)
data and software has been private to the collaborations operating the
telescopes. There is a general movement in science towards open data and
software and specifically the next big IACT, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA)
will be operated as an open observatory.

We have created a Github organisation at https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro
where we are developing data format specifications. A public mailing list was
set up at https://lists.nasa.gov/mailman/listinfo/open-gamma-ray-astro and a
first face-to-face meeting on IACT high-level data model and formats took place
in April 2016 in Meudon. We hope that this open multi-mission effort will help
accelerate the development of open data formats and open-source software for
gamma-ray astronomy, leading to synergies in the development of analysis codes
and eventually better scientific results (reproducible, multi-mission). This
poster will summarise what we have done so far and has the goal to solicit
comments and future contributions from the gamma-ray astronomy community.
