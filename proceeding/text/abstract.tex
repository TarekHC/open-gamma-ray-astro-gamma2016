In gamma-ray astronomy, a variety of data formats and proprietary software
exist, often developed for one specific mission or experiment. Especially for
ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), data and software
have been so far mostly private to the collaborations operating the telescopes.
However, there is a general movement in science towards open data and software
and the next big IACT array, the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), will be
operated as an open observatory.

We have created a Github organisation at \url{https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro}
where we are developing high-level data format specifications. A public mailing
list was set up at \url{https://lists.nasa.gov/mailman/listinfo/open-gamma-ray-astro}
and a first face-to-face meeting on the IACT high-level data model and formats
took place in April 2016 in Meudon (France). The hope is that this open
multi-mission effort will help to accelerate the development of open data
formats and open-source software for gamma-ray astronomy, leading to synergies
in the development of analysis codes and eventually better scientific results
(reproducible, multi-mission). This poster will summarize what we have done so
far, and has the goal to solicit comments and future contributions from the
gamma-ray astronomy community.
