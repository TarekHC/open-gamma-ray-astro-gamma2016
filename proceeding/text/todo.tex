\section{TODO}

We should probably mention these?

\begin{itemize}
    \item{} Mention how we work together besides Github: monthly telcons + planned bi-yearly f2f meetings?
    \item{} Is there anything we can cite for CTA data challenge 1 or data challenge 2 plans?
    \item{} Mention website and some info on how CTA is releasing IRF files at the moment (prod2)?
    \item{} The Instrument Response Function Format for the Cherenkov Telescope Array \cite{2015arXiv150807437W}
    - has now merged with this effort.
    \item{} Previous work to define a gamma-ray lightcurve format: \cite{2010AnA...524A..48T}
\end{itemize}
